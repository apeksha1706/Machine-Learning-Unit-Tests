# Machine Learning - Programming Assignments

### Unit Tests

I am working on unit tests for programming assignenments of each week of
Machine Learning Course from Coursera.  

Each test case was extracted from Course's Resource tab where we can find
the information to test each function properly.  

Using the code provided here should make a lot easier to try different
implementations, vectorization techniques, etc., without get lost or
break things up.
